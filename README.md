## What happens when you press the “submit” button? It takes you to this url : file:///action_page.php?

## What are the keys of this URL query string? How do they correspond to the “name” fields of your HTML form elements? Im not sure as of yet

## What are the values of the URL query string? How do they correspond to what the user entered or typed? The values correspond when the user inputs values the query string outputs the results and then gets them.
