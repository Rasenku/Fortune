## What happens when you press the “submit” button? It takes you to this url : file:///action_page.php?

## What are the keys of this URL query string? How do they correspond to the “name” fields of your HTML form elements? Im not sure as of yet

## What are the values of the URL query string? How do they correspond to what the user entered or typed? Query strings do not exist until a user plugs the variables into a database search, at which point the search engine will create the dynamic URL with the query string based on the results.
